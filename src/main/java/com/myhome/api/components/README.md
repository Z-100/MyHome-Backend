# :suspension_railway: Components
This represents the entire structure of the database and has all the controllers
in it, which are necessary for the communication between the services and the

## What are components?
Every single component represents one table in the database. <br/>
Multiple tables in certain components are possible, as the database also can have
multiple Many-to-Many relationships in between the tables.
